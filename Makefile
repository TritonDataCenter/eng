# Makefile: annotated sample Makefile using eng.git Makefile system
#
# The eng.git repository contains a system of Makefile components that provide
# pluggable Makefile functionality (the way is typically done for other
# programming environments, but isn't commonly done for Makefiles).  Makefiles
# defined in this repository generate targets for:
#
#     * building the current repository as an npm package
#     * checking syntax and style for JavaScript, JSON, bash files,
#       and SMF manifests
#     * generating API documentation from restdown sources
#     * generating manual pages from Markdown sources
#     * building a copy of Node with this repository
#     * loading a prebuilt copy of Node in this repository
#     * fetching git submodules as they are needed
#
# This top-level Makefile is both a sample Makefile for new repositories and
# a demo for how to use each of the Makefile components here.  If you find this
# comment in a Makefile outside of eng.git, that's a bug and should be fixed.
# Repos are expected to completely rewrite this file (possibly using it as a
# template).
#
# Writing new Makefile components is not hard, but requires thinking through how
# they may need to be customized.  Here are some guidelines:
#
#     * "Callers" (top-level Makefiles) should be able to use Makefile
#       components by setting specific Make variables ("input variables" for the
#       component) and then including the Makefile.  The component works by
#       defining output variables and (optionally) targets. See existing
#       components for examples.  Document clearly the input and output
#       variables for each new Makefile component.
#
#     * Most components actually consist of two files: a "defs" file that
#       consumes input variables and produces output variables, and a separate
#       "targ" file that defines targets.  Consumers include the "defs" Makefile
#       towards the top of their Makefile, before they've defined their own
#       repo-specific targets.  If components define targets at this point,
#       they'd become default targets, and can also lead to dependency problems.
#       Consumers include the "targ" Makefile after all definitions have been
#       made.
#
#     * Usually, a component should not define phony top-level targets (like
#       "check" or "manpages").  Instead, just define variables (like
#       MY_COMPONENTS_CHECK_TARGETS or MAN_OUTPUTS) that the caller can use to
#       trivially define such a target themselves.
#
#     * If you want to be able to use this Makefile more than once (e.g., with
#       different parameters), that's possible, but tricky.  See
#       Makefile.manpages.{defs,targ} for an example.
#

#
# IMPORTANT: This sample Makefile should consist solely of repo-specific
# configuration, plus "include" directives for the common Makefile components,
# plus trivial, repo-specific targets.  Repo-specific targets and recipes are
# okay, but generic targets and recipes do NOT belong here.  If you find
# yourself wanting to add support for new targets here, you should add them to a
# new or existing pluggable Makefile component, document it clearly, and include
# that Makefile here.
