# Check if the current build machine is supported for building this component
# and that the build environment seems sane.
#
# Most Joyent software is built using a common build environment described in
# https://github.com/joyent/triton/blob/master/docs/developer-guide/build-zone-setup.md.
# The quickest path to having a sane build environment likely involves following
# that document.
#
# Ideally, rather than checking the sanity of any random shell environment,
# we'd have a way to fully specify the build environment, sanitizing it so that
# only specific user-set environment variables are allowed. That is not done
# here.
#
# This is specifically a bash script because we're using its associative array
# support.
#
# Meant to be run from the top level of a git repository before commencing a
# build. It checks the following:
#
# - the pkgsrc version is compatible with one derived from $NODE_PREBUILT_IMAGE
#   or $BASE_IMAGE_UUID
# - our devzone has a delegated dataset
# - the list of pkgsrc packages match the ones installed on jenkins-agent images
# - the RBAC profiles(1) of the user, looking for 'Primary Administrator' or
#   uid=0
# - the build environment has a $PATH with /opt/local/bin before /usr/bin et al
# - our build platform for this component matches uname -vish
# - several non-pkgsrc programs needed by the build are availabe on the $PATH
# - git submodules for this repository, if present, are up to date
#

#
# For the NODE_PREBUILT_IMAGE checks, we use this list from
# From https://us-east.manta.joyent.com/Joyent_Dev/public/releng/sdcnode/README.html
# the following images versions are supported:
#
#    sdc-smartos@1.6.3: fd2cc906-8938-11e3-beab-4359c665ac99
#    sdc-minimal-multiarch-lts@15.4.1: 18b094b0-eb01-11e5-80c1-175dac7ddf02
#    minimal-64-lts@18.4.0: c2c31b00-1d60-11e9-9a77-ff9f06554b0f
#    minimal-64-lts@19.4.0: 59ba2e5e-976f-4e09-8aac-a4a7ef0395f5
#
# In the future, we would prefer if the pkgsrc versions were declared
# directly in Makefiles without needing this lookup. (see TOOLS-2038)
#

#
# NOTE If you modify this file, be sure to check that
# jenkins-agent.git:/toolbox/auto-user-script.sh is in sync with the set
# of pkgsrc packages installed per-pkgsrc version. It's not wonderful that
# these lists are duplicated here :-/
