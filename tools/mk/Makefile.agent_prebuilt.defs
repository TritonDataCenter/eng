# Makefile.agent_prebuilt.defs: A Makefile for components that need to bundle
# one of the Triton/Manta agents.
#

#
# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. If you find yourself changing
# this file, you should ensure that you test all consumers of it, since
# eng.git is a git submodule of several repositories. After testing, push
# changes to the eng.git gerrit project as normal, then do the following for
# each component that uses eng.git, likely reusing the original ticket subject
# for the commit message as was used for the eng.git push.
#
#    $ git submodule update --remote deps/eng
#    $ git add deps/eng
#    $ git commit -m "TOOLS-xxxx some description" deps/eng
#
# Then push those changes to gerrit as usual for review.
#

#
# This Makefile facilitates either downloading and caching a prebuilt agent
# tarball or cloning a fresh copy of the required agent source repository
# at the declared branch, building it once and caching the result.
#
# The supported agents are those commonly used by Triton or Manta components:
#
# TARGET     PKG              TARBALL
# amon       amon-agent       amon/amon-agent-*.tgz
# config     config-agent     config-agent/config-agent-*.tar.gz
# mackerel   mackerel-pkg     mackerel/mackerel-pkg-*.tar.gz
# minnow     minnow-pkg       minnow/minnow-pkg-*.tar.gz
# registrar  registrar-pkg    registrar/registrar-pkg-*.tar.gz
# waferlock  waferlock        waferlock/waferlock-pkg-*.tar.gz
#
# These can then be reused by the buildimage utility when assembling component
# images. The agent deliverables get extracted to $(BUILDIMAGE_STAGEDIR)
# during the build.
#

#
# Usage:
#
# - `include deps/eng/tools/mk/Makefile.agent_prebuilt.defs` after this in your
#   Makefile.
# - `include deps/eng/tools/mk/Makefile.agent_prebuilt.targ` near the end of
#   your Makefile.
# - set $(AGENTS) to one or more of the TARGETS from the table above
#
# The 'buildimage' target will use $(AGENTS) to determine which agents to
# build/download/extract to $(BUILDIMAGE_STAGEDIR) prior to assembling the
# image.
#

#
# When including this Makefile, you MAY specify:
#
#	AGENT_PREBUILT_DOWNLOAD_URL  The dir in which to find agent tarballs. This
#				can either be a *local directory* or *a
#				URL* dir (with trailing '/') which serves
#				Apache/Nginx dir listing HTML. This defaults to empty,
#				as we prefer to build agents on the build machine of the
#				component that's going to use them, rather than downloading
#				prebuilt ones. (default: '')
#
#	AGENT_PREBUILT_BRANCH	Specify a particular branch of 'agent' builds
#				from which to pull. This defaults to the value of $(BRANCH)
#
#	AGENT_PREBUILT_AGENT_BRANCH	Allow a separate branch name for agent builds,
#				allowing users to build one branch for their main component, and
#				another branch for the agents that component includes.
#				agent-prebuilt.sh first tries AGENT_PREBUILT_AGENT_BRANCH,
#				then AGENT_PREBUILT_BRANCH, and finally falls back to 'master'
#
#	BUILD		top-level directory for built binaries
#				(default: "build")
#

# To add a new agent to this file, define the following variables:
#
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_GIT_URL			the git repository to clone
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_REPO				the local repository name
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_AGENT_ENV		environment variables needed for the agent build
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_AGENT_TARGETS	the make targets in that repository to build
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_ROOTDIR			where in the image the package resides
# <AGENT>_PREBUILT_TARBALL_PATTERN	a regexp to match the built/downloaded agent
#
# then add the logic to define <name>_PREBUILT_TARGETS, likely reused from
# existing agent definitions.
