# NOTE: This makefile comes from the "eng" repo. If you find yourself changing
# this file, you should ensure that you test all consumers of it, since
# eng.git is a git submodule of several repositories. After testing, push
# changes to the eng.git repository as normal, then do the following for
# each component that uses eng.git, likely reusing the original ticket subject
# for the commit message as was used for the eng.git push.
#
#    $ git submodule update --remote deps/eng
#    $ git add deps/eng
#    $ git commit -m "TOOLS-xxxx some description" deps/eng
#
# Then create a PR as usual for review.
